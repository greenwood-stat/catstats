\title{Simulation-based hypothesis test for one proportion}
\usage{
one_proportion_test(
  probability_success = 0.5,
  sample_size = 5,
  summary_measure = c("number", "proportion"),
  as_extreme_as,
  direction = c("greater", "less", "two-sided"),
  number_repetitions = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{probability_success}{Value between 0 and 1
representing the null hypothesis value for proportion.}

\item{sample_size}{Number of trials used to compute proportion.}

\item{summary_measure}{Name of summary measure to return from simulations.
Allowed values are
\code{"number"} for number of successes or
\code{"proportion"} for proportion of successes.}

\item{as_extreme_as}{Value of observed statistic.
Between 0 and 1 if \code{summary_measure} is \code{"proportion"};
an integer between 1 and \code{sample_size} if \code{summary_measure} is \code{"number"}.}

\item{direction}{Direction of alternative hypothesis.
Allowed values are \code{"greater"}, \code{"less"}, or \code{"two-sided"}.}

\item{number_repetitions}{Number of simulated samples.}
}
\value{
Plot of distribution of simulated values,
with values as or more extreme than specified
value highlighted and reports
proportion of successes in simulations
as subtitle on plot.
}
\description{
This function will run a simulation-based hypothesis test
for the value of a single proportion.
