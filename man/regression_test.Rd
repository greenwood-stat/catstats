\title{Simulation-based test for regression}
\usage{
regression_test(
  formula,
  data,
  summary_measure = c("slope", "correlation"),
  direction = c("greater", "less", "two-sided"),
  as_extreme_as,
  number_repetitions = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula of the form response~predictor, where predictor defines two groups and response is binary or two-level categorical}

\item{data}{dataset with columns for response and predictor variable}

\item{summary_measure}{"slope" for test of slope or "correlation" for test of correlation}

\item{direction}{one of "greater", "less", or "two-sided" to give direction of hypothsis test}

\item{as_extreme_as}{value of observed statistic.}

\item{number_repetitions}{number of draws for simulation test}
}
\description{
Function to perform simulation-based test for slope of simple linear regression or correlation between two quantitative variables
