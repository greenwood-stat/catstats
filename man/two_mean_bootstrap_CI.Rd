\title{Function to create bootstrap confidence interval for difference in two means}
\usage{
two_mean_bootstrap_CI(
  formula,
  data,
  first_in_subtraction,
  confidence_level = 0.95,
  number_repetitions = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula of the form response~predictor, where predictor defines two groups and response is binary or two-level categorical}

\item{data}{Dataset with columns for response and predictor variable}

\item{first_in_subtraction}{Value of predictor that should be first in order of subtraction for computing statistics}

\item{confidence_level}{confidence level to use for interval construction in decimal form.  Default is 95\%}

\item{number_repetitions}{number of draws for simulation test}
}
\value{
Produces side-by-side boxplots of observed data and plot of distribution of simulated values, with values as or more extreme than specified value highlighted and count/proportion of those values reported as subtitle on plot
